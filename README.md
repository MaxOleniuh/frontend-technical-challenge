# Frontend Technical Challenge

Thank you for taking on this challenge, we appreciate the time and effort involved. We ask
that you spend no more than 3 hours on this task, if time becomes an issue, please focus on
finishing existing functionality.

What we’re looking for:

- Functionality matching the brief
- Consistent code style
- Good code structure, patterns & abstraction
- An intuitive and pleasant to use UI

For the development please use only the next technologies

- Next.js 13 - app directory ( only the app directory structure )
- Tailwind
- Do not use any other packages for components as we want to see your component structuring.

# The brief

The application has 2 tabs: Images & Predictions:

## Images

This tab gives the user capability to upload into memory (no need to call an API here) and
manage a list of images which will be used for further processing. The list of images should
be displayed in a tabular format with the following columns:

- Filename of the Image
- Size of the image
- Time of Upload
- A button called PREDICT
  On clicking the PREDICT button:
- A dialog box asking for ‘Title’ and ‘Description’ of the prediction should be displayed
- Dialog box should have option to Submit and Cancel
- On clicking submit the request to the api route should be made, saving the
  response against the image.
- On successful completion of the API request a single new entry would be added to
  the Predictions tab.
- On a failing API request, show an error message to the user

## Predictions

This tab gives users the ability to view the predictions generated by this app. The list of
predictions should be displayed in a tabular format with the following columns:

- Title (entered by the user in the dialog)
- Description (entered by the user in the dialog)
- Timestamp of running the prediction
- Button called VIEW
  On clicking the VIEW button
- The image on which the prediction was run should be displayed.
- All the items in the prediction of this image should be displayed.
- A transparent rectangle covering the coordinates in the prediction item should be
  displayed over the image for all items predicted within an image
- The “label” and “score” should be displayed along with the prediction for the item.
  Please refer to the image below for inspiration.

The above image shows 3 Prediction items using transparent rectangles having coordinates
returned by the API
